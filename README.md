In this task, we use advanced SQL techniques to analyze trends and patterns in a dataset.
Window Functions help rank employees and calculate running totals without grouping data.
Subqueries allow filtering data based on aggregated results, such as finding sales above average.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs) simplify complex queries by breaking them into temporary result sets.
These techniques help extract meaningful insights from large datasets for better decision-making.
